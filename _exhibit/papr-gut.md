A ritual is a performance in order to make a bridge
between this physical world with the other world.
At the moment, a body of a performer plays role as mediation.
The body can be you or anything temporary.
The ultimate aim of a ritual is perfect communication between bodies, spaces, and time.

Which shape is the sound of fire?
Whichkind of color is it?
Which kind of sound color is angry fire?
Is fire immaterial?
“So, like a forgotten fire, a childhood can always flare up again within us.”
- Gaston Bachelard
